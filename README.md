# Challenge 01

## *Step#1*

#### Go to **csharp**  -> **GildedRose.cs** -> `UpdateQuality()` function 


## *Step#2*

### **Challenge Requirement**

#### find the code Smell in the function `UpdateQuality()` and Refactor the function.
##### your repo should contain a README file and the refactored function.

- README file contains:

Code Smell:
it had along method
and smelly cody with many if's

Definition: 
The defintion is not clear, but if it means the def of code smell =>> it means that the code have many lines of stuff that are not needed(Comments/Long methods)

Solution:
Replacing some the if to function, to reduce the number of if's and reduce the method


> p.s. your refactored function have to work just like how the old `UpdateQuality()` function was working
